# biometric-authentication-infographic
Infographic project exploring biometric authentication and its role in enhancing password security. MSc Computer Science (CETM69 module).

This infographic was created as part of the **CETM69 Cybersecurity module** during my MSc Computer Science (graduating 2026).  
The focus is on **biometric authentication** and how it can enhance traditional password security for individuals and organisations.

## Objective
To communicate how **biometric technologies** such as fingerprint, facial, and voice recognition can strengthen cybersecurity and reduce data breaches caused by weak passwords.

## Key Topics Covered
- The growing **cybersecurity threats** associated with password-only systems  
- Integration of **biometrics with passwords** for multi-factor authentication  
- **Legal, ethical, and privacy** considerations of using biometric data  
- **User perception and experience** in adopting biometric security  

## Key Findings
- **81% of hacking incidents** are due to weak or stolen passwords.  
- **Fraud rates can be reduced by up to 70%** when biometrics are combined with passwords (O’Shea, 2023).  
- **85% of users** say their trust in a company increases when strong security measures are visible.  
- **40% of consumers** prefer faster, high-security authentication methods.

## Design & Presentation
The infographic combines **visual data**, **statistics**, and **citations** to communicate complex cybersecurity concepts clearly and effectively — an essential skill in modern computing.

## Result
**Score:** 65%
